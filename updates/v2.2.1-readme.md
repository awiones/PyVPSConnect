# RemotelyPy v2.2.1 Update

## Public IP Connection Fix

Version 2.2.1 of RemotelyPy addresses a critical issue where clients were unable to properly connect to the controller's public IP address. This update ensures that when you run a controller on a remote server (such as an AWS EC2 instance), clients can properly connect and execute commands on that remote server rather than executing them locally.

## What Was Fixed

### The Problem

In previous versions (v2.2.0 and earlier):

- When running the controller on a remote server with `--host <public-ip>`, the controller would correctly bind to all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
- However, when clients connected to this public IP, commands entered in the client would be executed on the local machine instead of on the remote server
- This made remote command execution ineffective, as the whole purpose is to run commands on the remote machine

### The Solution

The v2.2.1 update:

- Completely redesigns the client-server communication protocol
- Properly handles command routing between client and server
- Adds clear visual indicators showing which machine commands are running on
- Implements a `/local` command prefix for explicitly running commands on the local machine
- Improves public IP detection, especially on AWS EC2 instances

## How to Use

### Running the Controller (Server)

```bash
python main.py controller --host <your-public-ip>
```

### Connecting with a Client

```bash
python main.py client --host <server-public-ip> --port 5555
```

### Command Execution

- Regular commands (e.g., `ls`, `cd`, etc.) will execute on the remote server
- Commands with `/local` prefix (e.g., `/local ls`) will execute on your local machine
- Use `/quit` to exit the client

## Technical Improvements

1. **Enhanced IP Detection**

   - Added AWS EC2 metadata service detection
   - Implemented multiple fallback services for public IP detection
   - Better handling of network interfaces

2. **Improved Command Handling**

   - Added command tracking with unique IDs
   - Implemented proper message passing between client and controller
   - Added timeout handling to prevent hanging

3. **Better User Experience**
   - Clear visual distinction between remote and local execution
   - Improved prompt showing connected server and current directory
   - Better error messages and handling

## Security Considerations

- This update maintains the same security model as previous versions
- Ensure your firewall/security groups allow traffic on port 5555
- Consider implementing additional authentication if deploying in production environments
