## Updating from a Previous Version

1. Navigate to your RemotelyPy directory:

   ```bash
   cd RemotelyPy
   ```

2. Activate your virtual environment (if you're using one):

   python main.py --version
   ```

   You should see: `RemotelyPy v2.2.1`

## Running the Controller on a Remote Server

1. SSH into your remote server (e.g., AWS EC2 instance)

2. Install RemotelyPy following the steps above

3. Determine your server's public IP address:

   ```bash
   curl ifconfig.me
   ```

4. Start the controller with your public IP:

   ```bash
   python main.py controller --host <your-public-ip>
   ```

5. Ensure your server's security group/firewall allows inbound traffic on port 5555

## Connecting from a Client

1. Install RemotelyPy on your local machine following the steps above

2. Connect to the remote controller:

   ```bash
   python main.py client --host <server-public-ip> --port 5555
   ```

3. You should now be able to execute commands on the remote server

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues connecting:

1. Verify network connectivity:

   ```bash
   ping <server-public-ip>
   ```

2. Check firewall/security group settings:

   - Ensure port 5555 is open for inbound TCP traffic

3. Verify the controller is running:

   ```bash
   # On the server
   ps aux | grep python
   ```

4. Check logs for error messages:

   ```bash
   # Look for error messages in the terminal output
   ```

5. Try specifying the public IP explicitly on both sides:

   ```bash
   # On server
   python main.py controller --host <server-public-ip>

   # On client
   python main.py client --host <server-public-ip> --port 5555
   ```
