# RemotelyPy v2.2.1 Update

## Release Date: April 9, 2025

### Major Bug Fixes

#### Fixed Public IP Connection Issue

- **Issue**: In previous versions, clients were unable to properly connect to the controller's public IP address. When a client connected to a controller running on a remote server (such as AWS EC2), commands were being executed locally on the client machine instead of on the remote server.
- **Fix**: Completely redesigned the client-server communication protocol to properly handle remote command execution.

#### Improved IP Address Detection

- Enhanced the `get_public_ip()` function to more reliably detect public IP addresses, especially on AWS EC2 instances
- Added AWS EC2 metadata service as the first detection method
- Implemented multiple fallback services for public IP detection

### Client Improvements

- Added clear distinction between remote and local command execution
- Implemented `/local` command prefix to explicitly run commands on the local machine
- Added improved remote command prompt showing the connected server
- Fixed command response handling to properly display output from remote servers
- Added better error handling and timeout mechanisms

### Controller Improvements

- Enhanced controller to properly handle command requests from clients
- Improved binding behavior to ensure connections work on both public and private interfaces
- Added clearer network information display showing binding address vs. connection address

### Technical Details

- Implemented proper message passing between client and controller
- Added command tracking with unique IDs to match requests with responses
- Improved error handling with detailed logging
- Added timeout handling to prevent hanging on lost connections

## Upgrade Instructions

1. Update to the latest version: `git pull origin main`
2. Install any new dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the controller on your server with the public IP: `python main.py controller --host <your-public-ip>`
4. Connect from clients using: `python main.py client --host <server-public-ip> --port 5555`

## Notes

- This update maintains backward compatibility with existing scripts
- Security groups/firewall rules still need to allow traffic on port 5555
